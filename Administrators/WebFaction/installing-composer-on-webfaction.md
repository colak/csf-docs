# Installing Composer on production server

Different web hosts might have different requirements to consider, but for [WebFaction](https://www.webfaction.com), our host, installation was easy.

First, tunnel into the server via ssh. Then ensure you're in the $HOME location (i.e. account root: _home/username_). Then run the following six commands, one at a time:

1. `git clone https://github.com/composer/composer.git`
1. `git clone https://github.com/composer/composer.git`
1. `wget http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar`
1. `cd composer`
1. `php70 ../composer.phar install`
1. `find ./bin -type f -executable | xargs sed -i 's/env php$/env php70/g'`

Note the last two commands require targeting which PHP version you need, which in our case on WebFaction servers was PHP 7.0, thus "php70".

For WebFaction, this installs Composer at _/home/username/composer/bin/composer_, and anything that needs to run Composer on the server (regardless of which _/webapp_ directory) can reference Composer as:

`/home/username/composer/bin/composer whatever-app`
